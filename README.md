## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java: You need Java 8 or higher installed on your system.
- MySQL: Make sure you have a MySQL database instance set up.
- Maven: You'll need Maven as the build tool.

## Frameworks_and_Libraries_Used
- Spring Boot: A powerful framework for building Java applications.
- Swagger: Used for API documentation.
- Hibernate: Object-relational mapping library.
- Apache HttpClient: For making HTTP requests.
- Lombok: For reducing boilerplate code.
- Jackson: For JSON serialization and deserialization.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone <https://github.com/Akash-376/Battery-management-system.git>
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   In which POM.xml is visible
```
cd Battery-management-system
```
3. Build the project using Maven:
```
mvn clean install
```

## Configuration
1. Create the database named 'smart_batteries' using MySQL Workbench
2. Open application.properties in the src/main/resources directory.
3. Configure your database settings:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/smart_batteries
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
```
Replace username and password with yours.

## Running the Application
1. Run the application using Maven:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
2. The application should now be running on the specified port (default is 8080).

## API Endpoints
Swagger documentation is available at http://localhost:8088/swagger-ui.html. You can use it to explore and test the API endpoints.

## Usage
### Creating a New Battery
To create a new battery instance, send a POST request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/
```
Note: In the payload, you only need to send the battery model (data type: String) in the format provided below.
```
{
    "battery_model":"abc"
}
```

### Starting Data Transmission from a Battery
To start sending data from a battery, send a POST request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/startsendingdata/{batteryId}
```

### Retrieving Detailed Information about a Battery
To retrieve detailed information about a specific battery, send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/{batteryId}
```

### Retrieving All Data Entries of a battery
To retrieve all data for a specific battery, send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/info/{batteryId}
```
### Retrieving the Latest Voltage Record
To retrieve the latest voltage record for a specific battery, send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/voltage/{batteryId}
```
### Retrieving the Latest Current Record
To retrieve the latest current record for a specific battery, send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/current/{batteryId}
```
### Retrieving the Latest Temperature Record
To retrieve the latest temperature record for a specific battery, send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/temperature/{batteryId}
```
### Retrieving Battery Data Entries Within a Time Range
To retrieve battery data entries within a specific time range, send a GET request to:
```
http://localhost:8080/smart_battery/track/{batteryId}/{startTime}/{endTime}
```
Example of time : 2023-08-31T21:10:17

Replace {batteryId}, {startTime}, and {endTime} with the appropriate values.
